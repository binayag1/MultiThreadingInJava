# In this Commit: 
	Since, Runnable Interface has only one method that is Run(). So in this case we can reduce the number of
	line and write lambda expression. In this example, two class has been replaced with lambda expression. Same task has been done with less number of code. I would recommend to run lambda expression in java 8 to get
	better result.
