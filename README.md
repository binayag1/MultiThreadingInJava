	The default priority of thread is 5 which is normal priority. We can set low and maximum priority by using 
	value 1 and 10. The priority of thread can be known by using thread.getPriority() and set by using thread.setPriority(). The name of thread can be known by using thread.getName() and set by using thread.setName() OR we can assign name during the creation of thread as shown in example.
