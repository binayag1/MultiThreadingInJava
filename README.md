# In this Commit: 
	In previous example, class Thread was used to achieve multithreading. This time the example has been used 
	Runnable Interface. Runnable Interface has only one method which is Run. 
	In Thread class we used, thread.start() method to start thread but this time we will implements 
	Runnable Interface in both of the class and will create two thread in App class. 
	But this time we will create object of Runnable and pass that to the Thread.
